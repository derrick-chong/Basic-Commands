Basic Commands for Git/Terminal

#CLI commands follow the recipe of: command flag argument

#arguments is what the command will modify
#you can have zero arguments or flags, depending on the command

#Some useful commands:

ls #lists files and folders in current directory

ls -a #the -a will list hidden and unhidden files/folders (the -a is a flag!)

ls -ltrh #

cd # change directory to home directory

cd .. #change directory one level above

mkdir FileName #FileName is the name of file you want, it makes a directory

touch File_Name #creates empty file called File_name in the working directory

cp file_name Directory_you_want_to_copy_to #takes the file and copies it
